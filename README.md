# oostubs
Pleanse note that we don't allow working directly on the master branch. New feature should be implemented on other branch and merged to master after test and team review

## How to get update from official repo
```
#git remote add upstream https://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/Studium/OSC/SS2022/oostubs.git
 git pull upstream main
```
If you just want it to download the changes without automatically merging, use git fetch instead of git pull.
